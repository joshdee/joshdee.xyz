        </div>
        <p>Welcome to my homepage. It's plain, I know. I'm not an expert on JavaScript or some other web programming language and can't make a site design for crap, so I took the CSS declaration, edited it and swapped the colors from <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this wonderful site</a>. It's pretty cool. I suggest you should check it out. I made this dark so that y'all wouldn't go blind.</p>

I can't code, I completely suck at it. I actually tinker around with devices most if not all the time. I am also a transit enthusiast.</p>
